# Codeball Todo MVC

Hey, this repository tracks the development of "CodeballMVC". A TodoMVC-like application built entirely with Codeball
and OpenAI Codex, using instructions such as:

> Add a /tasks endpoint listing all tasks in a sqlite database

and

> Update the add() method to return the id of the task created

The entire generated file is in `app.py`, and a new version of the file is created after every prompt.
